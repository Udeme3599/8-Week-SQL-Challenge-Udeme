Danny Ma 8 Week SQL Challenge
This repository contains my solutions to the 8 Week SQL Challenge created by Danny Ma. The challenge consists of real-world case studies that test and improve SQL skills through data exploration, cleaning, and analysis. Each case study tackles unique scenarios, including customer loyalty, sales performance, and operational metrics, providing valuable practice in SQL querying and problem-solving.
